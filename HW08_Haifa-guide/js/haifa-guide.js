In 1939 after her family had already left, a few weeks before World War II, she fled Nazi Germany, alone, penniless and without a passport.\n" +
            "            <p>She was in Geneva when the war broke out, and there she met the sculptor Henri Paquet, whom she married in 1941. Ursula and Henri have a daughter Claudine born in 1945, who has two sons. Since 1967, Ursula Malbin has divided her creative life between the Artists’ Village of Ein Hod in Israel and the village of Troinex near Geneva in Switzerland.\n" +
            "            <p>Malbin’s work is exceptional in its simplicity, in its fragile yet graceful depiction of the human form, and its celebration of the enduring beauty of life despite all vicissitudes. To maintain the purity of her inspiration, the artist works without models, relying only on her imagination for the pure, sculptured indication of her attitude to life.\n" +
            "            <p>Over the years, Malbin’s works have found their way into Hospitals, Parks, Gardens, Schools and private collections in Europe and North America. One original of each of her creations is donated to the Sculpture Garden in Haifa that opened to the public in 1978.</p>"

The main shrine known as the \"Cave of Elijah\" is located on Haifa's Allenby Road, on Mount Carmel, approximately 40 m above sea level. For centuries, it has been a destination for Jewish, Christian, Muslim and Druze pilgrims.[2] The Cave of Elijah in Allenby Road is divided into twos sections for praying, one for men and one for women; the cave is behind a velvet curtain.[3] The Cave is also known as el-Khader in Arabic.[4] The Druze regard it as holy,[2] and many among them identify Elijah as \"el-Khidr\", the green prophet who symbolizes water and life.</p>" +
